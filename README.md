# Portfolio
## Project 
In this project we were tasked to make a professional portfolio, for us to use for our future endeavors and such.
## Design
On this porfolio, I used many css styles to get the look to my liking. Border styles, border color, width, height, padding, display, a few felx properties, and a few animations (FadeIn, FadeInUp). Most of the styles lisetd i learned in class and was able to put them in use, however I had to do some research in using the animations properties through google, MDN, geeks4Geeks, and some github resources. i used the animation properties and linked those with keyframes in the Css.file.
## Closing 
The code will run a sophisticated portfolio, with bright color pallets and show my Projects, Profile, and contact info.
## User Error
A few user errors I got along the way were not setting up the brackets correctly, and making my pictures clickable. However, I made the title of the images as a hyperlink (currently not linked to a website).
